# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Book Management System is a RESTful API built with NestJS that enables comprehensive management of books and their authors. The system provides full CRUD operations for both entities with proper data validation, error handling, and relationship management between authors and books.

## Glossary

- **Book Management System**: The NestJS-based RESTful API application for managing books and authors
- **Author Entity**: A database entity representing book authors with personal information
- **Book Entity**: A database entity representing books with metadata and author relationships
- **API Client**: External applications or users consuming the RESTful API endpoints
- **Database**: The persistent storage system (SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to create new authors, so that I can establish author records before adding their books to the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API Client sends a POST request to /authors with valid author data, THE Book Management System SHALL create a new Author Entity and return the created author object with a 201 status code
2. THE Book Management System SHALL require firstName and lastName fields for Author Entity creation
3. THE Book Management System SHALL accept optional bio and birthDate fields for Author Entity creation
4. THE Book Management System SHALL automatically generate createdAt and updatedAt timestamps for new Author Entity records
5. IF the API Client sends invalid data, THEN THE Book Management System SHALL return a 400 Bad Request with validation error details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to retrieve author information, so that I can display author details and manage author records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API Client sends a GET request to /authors, THE Book Management System SHALL return a list of all Author Entity records
2. WHERE pagination parameters are provided, THE Book Management System SHALL return paginated results with page and limit query parameters
3. WHERE search parameters are provided, THE Book Management System SHALL filter Author Entity records by firstName or lastName with partial, case-insensitive matching
4. WHEN the API Client sends a GET request to /authors/:id with a valid author ID, THE Book Management System SHALL return the specific Author Entity object
5. IF the requested Author Entity does not exist, THEN THE Book Management System SHALL return a 404 Not Found response

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to update author information, so that I can maintain accurate author records over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API Client sends a PATCH request to /authors/:id with valid partial author data, THE Book Management System SHALL update the specified Author Entity and return the updated object
2. THE Book Management System SHALL update the updatedAt timestamp when Author Entity modifications occur
3. THE Book Management System SHALL validate all provided fields during Author Entity updates
4. IF the Author Entity to update does not exist, THEN THE Book Management System SHALL return a 404 Not Found response
5. IF invalid data is provided, THEN THE Book Management System SHALL return a 400 Bad Request with validation error details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to delete authors, so that I can remove obsolete author records from the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API Client sends a DELETE request to /authors/:id for an existing Author Entity, THE Book Management System SHALL remove the author record and return a 204 No Content response
2. IF the Author Entity to delete does not exist, THEN THE Book Management System SHALL return a 404 Not Found response
3. IF the Author Entity has associated Book Entity records, THEN THE Book Management System SHALL prevent deletion and return a 409 Conflict response
4. THE Book Management System SHALL ensure referential integrity when processing Author Entity deletion requests

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to create new books, so that I can add book records with proper author associations to the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API Client sends a POST request to /books with valid book data including an existing authorId, THE Book Management System SHALL create a new Book Entity and return the created book object with linked author information
2. THE Book Management System SHALL require title, isbn, and authorId fields for Book Entity creation
3. THE Book Management System SHALL enforce unique ISBN constraint across all Book Entity records
4. THE Book Management System SHALL accept optional publishedDate and genre fields for Book Entity creation
5. IF the provided authorId does not reference an existing Author Entity, THEN THE Book Management System SHALL return a 400 Bad Request response

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to retrieve book information, so that I can display book details with author information and manage book records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API Client sends a GET request to /books, THE Book Management System SHALL return a list of all Book Entity records with linked Author Entity information
2. WHERE pagination parameters are provided, THE Book Management System SHALL return paginated results with page and limit query parameters
3. WHERE search parameters are provided, THE Book Management System SHALL filter Book Entity records by title or isbn with partial, case-insensitive matching
4. WHERE authorId filter is provided, THE Book Management System SHALL return only Book Entity records associated with the specified Author Entity
5. WHEN the API Client sends a GET request to /books/:id with a valid book ID, THE Book Management System SHALL return the specific Book Entity object with linked Author Entity information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to update book information, so that I can maintain accurate book records and metadata.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API Client sends a PATCH request to /books/:id with valid partial book data, THE Book Management System SHALL update the specified Book Entity and return the updated object
2. THE Book Management System SHALL update the updatedAt timestamp when Book Entity modifications occur
3. THE Book Management System SHALL validate all provided fields during Book Entity updates
4. THE Book Management System SHALL enforce unique ISBN constraint during Book Entity updates
5. IF the Book Entity to update does not exist, THEN THE Book Management System SHALL return a 404 Not Found response

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an API client, I want to delete books, so that I can remove obsolete book records from the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the API Client sends a DELETE request to /books/:id for an existing Book Entity, THE Book Management System SHALL remove the book record and return a 204 No Content response
2. IF the Book Entity to delete does not exist, THEN THE Book Management System SHALL return a 404 Not Found response
3. THE Book Management System SHALL allow Book Entity deletion without affecting associated Author Entity records

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As an API client, I want consistent error handling across all endpoints, so that I can reliably handle and display error conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Book Management System SHALL return consistent error response format with statusCode, message, and error fields
2. WHEN validation errors occur, THE Book Management System SHALL return a 400 Bad Request with detailed validation error information
3. WHEN requested resources do not exist, THE Book Management System SHALL return a 404 Not Found response
4. WHEN unique constraint violations occur, THE Book Management System SHALL return a 409 Conflict response
5. THE Book Management System SHALL implement custom exception filters for standardized error handling

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that I can ensure system reliability and facilitate future maintenance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Book Management System SHALL include unit tests for all service layer CRUD operations using Jest framework
2. THE Book Management System SHALL include end-to-end tests for critical API endpoints using Supertest
3. THE Book Management System SHALL use mocking for external dependencies in unit tests
4. THE Book Management System SHALL validate both successful operations and error conditions in test suites
5. THE Book Management System SHALL maintain test coverage for data validation and business logic components
